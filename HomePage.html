     <p>YAO! It's ya boy. Kam, the Enterprise. Just wanted to make this site to show you all another one of my skills, <strong>web developent!</strong>
        As I continue to learn and grow, my websites will become better and better. 
        With this in mind, one day I hope to be a professional remote full-stack web developer that can help just about anybody who's serious about a business grow a functional website from scratch, 
        which will allow them to further grow and exploit their potential.
